chunk1 = "The trial of Sam Bankman-Fried is likely to be more consequential than just whether the man himself is found guilty. Depending on what evidence is introduced during the trial, it could be rough for the entire crypto industry.\n\n\u201cHow much damage can this trial do to the already beaten-down reputation of the industry at this point?\u201d asks Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThis trial is going to be an excruciating moment for the industry because no one knows what kind of evidence might come out.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried, the founder of FTX and Alameda Research, is facing seven counts of criminal charges: two counts of wire fraud, and five counts of conspiracy charges. FTX was a failed cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2019. According to a now-deleted profile from FTX investors Sequoia Capital, FTX was founded because of Bankman-Fried\u2019s frustration with other exchanges when he was running Alameda Research, his crypto trading firm. According to the SEC, FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d diverting customers\u2019 funds to Alameda.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges \u2014 with a \u201cmulti-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.\u201d Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.\n\n\u201cReally just old-fashioned embezzlement.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s left of FTX is now being led by John J. Ray III \u2014 you may remember him as the guy who cleaned up Enron and who also said FTX is worse than Enron. Just before the trial began, the FTX lawyers filed suit against Bankman-Fried\u2019s parents, saying they should give back millions of dollars they got from their kid. Ray has also referred to Bankman-Fried\u2019s conduct as \u201creally just old-fashioned embezzlement.\u201d\n\nWe have some inkling of what the government will be arguing thanks to the filings prosecutors are making in this case. They argue that Bankman-Fried lied about consumer protection and that Bankman-Fried\u2019s statements that FTX was \u201cavoiding or managing conflicts of interest\u201d and that \u201cas a general principle FTX segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms\u201d were lies, in a superseding indictment filed August 14th.\n\nThe indictment also says that there were special features in FTX\u2019s code that \u201cpermitted Alameda to spend and withdraw unlimited amounts of money from FTX,\u201d which were created at Bankman-Fried\u2019s direction. That effectively exempted Alameda from the kinds of risk management other customers faced. At the same time, the government alleges, \u201cBankman-Fried publicly and repeatedly asserted that Alameda did not have privileged access to FTX.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried is accused of using \u201cbillions of dollars in misappropriated FTX customer deposits\u201d to help buy more than $200 million of real estate for himself, make billions of dollars of investments for his own interest, and repay Alameda\u2019s lenders, according to the indictment, Additionally, Bankman-Fried allegedly used more than $100 million of customer funds to make political contributions; prosecutors can show evidence of those contributions in this trial, even though they aren\u2019t part of the charges brought. A second trial is scheduled for March 2024, with additional charges.\n\nBefore his fall, Bankman-Fried made himself out to be the Good Boy of crypto \u2014 the trustworthy face of a sometimes-shady industry. He was also very interested in publicity, sitting for many interviews both before and after the fall of FTX. The quick rise of FTX as an industry force was at least in part due to Bankman-Fried\u2019s appetite for attention. Here are the hits:\n\nBankman-Fried gave interviews freely \u2014 and quickly rose to public prominence in the industry. Though FTX hadn\u2019t been in the business as long as competing exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, or Gemini, Bankman-Fried positioned himself as an important, boyish face for crypto. (At one point, Bankman-Fried told a colleague at FTX that \u201cI honestly think it\u2019s negative EV [this may mean \u201cexpected value,\u201d as in poker] for me to cut my hair. I think it\u2019s important for people to think I look crazy.\u201d)\n\nBecause he was so successful at this kind of public relations, his fall from grace was another mark against an industry that was already roiled by bankruptcies and scandals. Some additional trouble for the crypto industry is likely to come from one crucial element of the fraud trial \u2014 the part where the government must prove intent.\n\nThe first part of proving the government\u2019s case is pretty simple and a little boring: prosecutors must show that certain transactions took place. Whatever records the Southern District of New York has for the transactions will be shown.\n\n\u201cWhat conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?\u201d\n\nThe second part is where all the drama is likely to come, says Christopher LaVigne, a litigation partner and co-chair of the cryptocurrency practice at the law firm Withers. Prosecutors have to connect those transactions to Bankman-Fried, show that he knew what he was doing was wrong, and prove that he lied about it anyway.\n\n\u201cWhat was he saying to his parents and his other advisors about this?\u201d LaVigne says. \u201cWhat conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?\u201d\n\nTo further establish intent, the government can use Bankman-Fried\u2019s own words. The indictment calls Bankman-Fried\u2019s tweets in November 2022 \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had him going out directly to the internet,\u201d LaVigne says. If he wrote things on Twitter or said things in interviews that weren\u2019t true, that\u2019s more fodder for the government\u2019s case. \u201cThey can point to that and say, \u2018This is what he said, this is what actually happened.\u2019\u201d\n\nOther evidence may include Signal messages and testimony from co-conspirators who plead guilty to their own charges. Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, who was also sometimes Bankman-Fried\u2019s girlfriend, may play an important role \u2014 Bankman-Fried leaked her diaries to The New York Times and was consequently jailed for witness tampering. The government has indicated FTX co-founder Gary Wang and engineering head Nishad Singh will also be among the witnesses called to give testimony about Bankman-Fried.\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defense can also introduce risks for people who dealt with him\n\nThere may be testimony from lenders, venture capitalists, and customers in order to establish the basis for some charges. In the indictment, the prosecutors allege that Bankman-Fried lied to FTX investors. Some of those investors may be called on to testify, which is not the kind of thing VC big shots generally enjoy \u2014 and which might create collateral damage for the industry.\n\nIf, for instance, Sequoia Capital did due diligence around its investment in FTX, whatever Bankman-Fried told its partners could be important. Was FTX already sending Alameda customer funds at that point? Did Bankman-Fried know about it? And did he tell VCs at the time? (If he told them it wasn\u2019t happening, that would establish intent.) Binance was also an early investor in FTX, and former executives may be called on to testify as well, says Hermine Wong, the former head of policy at Coinbase and a former SEC regulator.\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defense can also introduce risks for people who dealt with him. Defense lawyers have several simultaneous objectives. First and foremost, they\u2019re trying to prove their client is not guilty. But just in case they don\u2019t get the outcome they want, they\u2019re also laying the groundwork for appeals and sentencing arguments. Any piece of evidence they want to introduce for those two purposes has to come into play in the trial.\n\nAlready, Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers are marking arguments that his constitutional rights are being violated by his pretrial incarceration because, among other things, his internet connection wasn\u2019t good enough for him to plan his defense, notes LaVigne. That could be grounds for an appeal.\n\n\u201cIs he going to throw the entire industry under the bus?\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s behavior after the fall of FTX suggests he\u2019s something of a wild card. He may suggest he was acting on the advice of his lawyers. But he may also introduce other evidence that could be troublesome \u2014 implying, for instance, that he was engaged in standard industry behavior or that everything that happened was Binance\u2019s fault. That may be risky, but we already know that Bankman-Fried loves risk.\n\n\u201cIs he going to throw the entire industry under the bus?\u201d Wong asks. \u201cAn idea like, \u2018Everyone was doing this, it\u2019s not fair I\u2019m the only one who was charged?\u2019\u201d That may not fly in a court of law, but it could absolutely damage public perception of crypto at large.\n\nFor instance, just before he was arrested, Bankman-Fried brought forward messages from a crypto group chat in testimony he planned to give before Congress. In that testimony, he primarily blames Binance and his lawyers at the firm Sullivan & Cromwell.\n\nIt\u2019s possible other messages from group chats may be brought into evidence during the trial. That can potentially be embarrassing for the whole industry, Wong says.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine some of these founders, CEOs, people of that echelon talk to each other somewhat informally about what\u2019s going on,\u201d she says. If it seems like his peer group supported him, or worse, fawned over him, that\u2019s a real problem for the industry\u2019s reputation.\u201d\n\nAfter FTX declared bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried went on an extensive media tour, doing interviews with The New York Times\u2019 Andrew Ross Sorkin and Good Morning America. Even under house arrest, he did interviews, including with The New Yorker. Bankman-Fried seemed to think that if he just explained things, everyone would understand that what he did was a mistake, not a crime."
chunk2 = "SBF\u2019s trial has started, this is how he and FTX got here\n\nThe highly anticipated criminal trial for Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, started Tuesday to determine whether he\u2019s guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. And as one former federal prosecutor put it: \u201cThe odds seem to be stacked against him at this point.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old co-founded FTX in 2019; within a few years the once third-largest crypto exchange\u2019s valuation hit $32 billion at its peak. It\u2019s now trying to claw back any funds to distribute to creditors.\n\nBut how did the once third-largest crypto exchange get here?\n\nBefore FTX, Bankman-Fried co-founded crypto-trading firm Alameda Research in 2017. He co-founded FTX in 2019 as a complement to Alameda, to help bring in revenue and liquidity for the trading arm.\n\nWithin two years, more than 80 investors provided about $2 billion in capital to FTX, helping Bankman-Fried propel his vision into a reality. In January 2022, the company raised $400 million in a Series C round, boosting its valuation to $32 billion. That was its last round of public funding.\n\nThe company gained somewhat mainstream recognition with branding deals and partnerships. For example, in 2021 it bought the naming rights for the Miami Heat\u2019s home arena. FTX also got its name branded on Major League Baseball umpires\u2019 polos, and it partnered with celebrities like Tom Brady and his ex-wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, as well as Steph Curry, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Naomi Osaka, among others. He also had close ties to U.S. regulators and government officials, many of whom he donated to.\n\nBankman-Fried was even compared to Warren Buffet and many called him the white horse of crypto (TechCrunch never did, for what it\u2019s worth).\n\nBut in early November 2022, that all changed.\n\nFTX\u2019s collapse\n\nConcerns surrounding FTX\u2019s liquidity grew after CoinDesk published a copy of Alameda\u2019s balance sheet, showing the firm held $14.6 billion in assets and $8 billion in liabilities as of June 30, 2022.\n\nBut there was a problem: The report showed Alameda\u2019s largest asset was $3.66 billion of \u201cunlocked FTT\u201d and $2.16 billion of \u201cFTT collateral.\u201d FTT was the token behind FTX.\n\nThe balance sheet showed that the $5.82 billion in FTT tokens that Alameda owned was 193% higher than the total FTT market cap, which was about $3 billion at the time. That means it purported to have more FTT tokens on its balance sheet than what existed in the world.\n\nAround the same time it was exposed, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, started pulling out its remaining $2.1 billion equivalent of cash in BUSD and FTT. (It had an equity position in FTX from 2019 to 2021.) This essentially triggered a bank run on FTX.\n\nFTX and Alameda filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. mid-November 2022. Bankman-Fried resigned, and John J. Ray III, the Enron turnaround veteran, was appointed its new CEO.\n\nBankman-Fried, however, maintained his innocence. At The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit, he appeared virtually from the Bahamas, saying \u201cI didn\u2019t ever try to commit fraud on anyone; I was shocked by what happened this month.\u201d In a published DM exchange with a Vox reporter, he said he regretted filing for bankruptcy and thought that \u201cregulators make everything worse.\u201d\n\nSBF arrested\n\nBankman-Fried was arrested in December 2022 in the Bahamas, where FTX was based. He was then extradited to the U.S. to face a number of criminal charges. He was released on a $250 million bail bond, and he remained under house arrest at his parents\u2019 home in Palo Alto. This was revoked in August after he was accused of intimidating Alameda\u2019s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, by leaking her private diary.\n\nRay represented the company during a House Financial Services Committee hearing regarding FTX. When asked whether the firm had significant risk management systems, Ray said at the time that \u201cthere were virtually no internal controls and no separateness whatsoever\u201d and added that he did not \u201ctrust a single piece of paper\u201d in the exchange\u2019s organization. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams called Bankman-Fried\u2019s alleged crimes \u201cone of the biggest financial frauds in American history,\u201d in a press conference.\n\nThe aftermath\n\nFTX co-founder and former CTO Gary Wang, and Alameda Research\u2019s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, both pleaded guilty in December 2022 to federal criminal charges in relation to the FTX collapse. They\u2019re also facing civil penalties from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alongside the criminal charges. Wang and Ellison plan to cooperate with prosecutors and will be major witnesses in the trial, given their close ties to Bankman-Fried, FTX and Alameda.\n\nIn January, Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to all counts, which include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to misuse customer funds. He could face up to 115 years in jail if convicted on all charges.\n\nThe crypto industry as a whole suffered from FTX\u2019s collapse, which was the first of many. BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 in November 2022, as did Genesis Global Trading in January.\n\nWhere we are today\n\nBankman-Fried will be represented by Cohen & Gresser, and Mark Cohen, a high-profile defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, will be the lead attorney. If that name sounds familiar, it might be because he also represented Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex trafficking trial related to Jeffrey Epstein. He requested an early release for Bankman-Fried but was denied.\n\nWith the trial beginning, we\u2019re witnessing how FTX\u2019s story ends. But what\u2019s on our mind is what happens to the investors and creditors affected by the collapse? And what happens to the billions in crypto assets tied up in legal proceedings?"

It\u2019s TC\u2019s column that highlights the major stories over the past few days, and \u2014 we humbly submit \u2014 it\u2019s a darn useful resource for folks on the go.\n\nThis week, we cover Sam Altman backing a teen\u2019s AI startup, Google\u2019s hardware event (and first impressions of the Pixel 8 Pro), Flexport drama, and the ongoing FTX fallout. Also on the agenda: Gmail\u2019s harsher rules to prevent spam, TikTok testing an ad-free subscription plan, and LinkedIn going big on AI tools. And that\u2019s not all.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t, sign up here to get WiR in your inbox every Saturday. And if you have, our thanks. Now, let\u2019s get on with the news.\n\nMost read\n\nAltman backs teen entrepreneurs: Sam Altman is among the backers of an AI startup, founded by two teenagers, that\u2019s aiming to assist businesses in automating workflows in \u201cpreviously unexplored\u201d ways. Manish writes that Induced AI, founded this year, lets businesses input their back-office tasks in plain English and converts the instructions to pseudo-code in real time.\n\nGoogle unveils new hardware: This week was Google\u2019s annual hardware event, where the search and consumer tech giant showed off what it\u2019s been working on. Christine wrote up a thorough roundup of the news, which included updates on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, Android 14, Pixel Buds, Google Assistant, Bard, Pixel Watch 2 and other goodies.\n\nHands on with the Pixel 8 Pro: Darrell took the newly unveiled Pixel 8 Pro for a whirl, and he liked what he saw. While very similar to last year\u2019s model (the Pixel 7 Pro), Darrell felt that the improved cameras, brighter screen and enhanced AI-powered features made it enough of an upgrade to (potentially) warrant a purchase \u2014 minus the underutilized temperature sensor. Stay tuned for his full review.\n\nTurmoil at Flexport: Dave Clark, the former Amazon executive who was ousted as CEO of Flexport just a year into the job, fired back at its founder and board, calling recent reporting on the logistics company \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d Clark made the comments Monday in a lengthy post on social media site X following a report from CNBC that provided new information about his last days at Flexport, a freight forwarding and customs brokerage startup valued at $8 billion.\n\nSBF allegedly tried to buy off Trump: The TC team\u2019s been trained on the Manhattan Federal Court for the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced entrepreneur accused of orchestrating the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. But fascinating details about SBF\u2019s political dealings are emerging from a book by Michael Lewis, \u201cGoing Infinite,\u201d that debuted on the first day of the trial, like SBF\u2019s attempt to buy off Trump to get him to not run again for president.\n\nGmail fights back against spammers: Google this week announced a series of significant changes to how it handles email from bulk senders in an effort to cut down on spam and other unwanted emails. The company says that, starting next year, bulk senders will need to authenticate their emails, offer an easy way to unsubscribe and stay under a reported spam threshold.\n\nTikTok tests an ad-free tier: TikTok is testing an ad-free subscription tier for some users. For $4.99, subscribers get an ad-free experience on TikTok \u2014 no other strings attached. But don\u2019t look for the option to arrive anytime soon. TikTok says that it\u2019s piloting the plan in a single, English-speaking market outside the U.S. for now.\n\nLinkedIn leans into AI tools: LinkedIn this week unveiled a string of new AI features spanning its job hunting, marketing and sales products, Ingrid writes. They include a big update to its Recruiter talent sourcing platform, with AI assistance built into it throughout; an AI-powered LinkedIn Learning coach; and a new AI-powered tool for marketing campaigns.\n\nMusk comes clean about X\u2019s metrics \u2014 maybe: In September, Elon Musk said that X users were generating a lot of content \u2014 creating 100 million to 200 million posts every day, excluding retweets. But speaking at an event this week, X CEO Linda Yaccarino offered a contradictory figure. She claimed X was seeing 500 million posts per day on the platform. So who\u2019s right? Beats us.\n\nFormer NSA director\u2019s startup shutters: IronNet, a once-promising cybersecurity startup founded by a former NSA director, has shuttered and laid off its remaining staff following its collapse. The Virginia-based IronNet was founded in 2014 by retired four-star general Keith Alexander and had raised more than $400 million in funding. But IronNet failed to gain traction after going public in August 2021, and its stock price continued to steeply decline in the wake of an initial spike.\n\nAudio\n\nOn the hunt for a new podcast to listen to while you work out, do the dishes or rake the leaves (now that fall\u2019s arrived)? Look no further than TechCrunch\u2019s roster, which covers the world of startups, the blockchain and more.\n\nOn Equity this week, the crew talked about the SBF trial; deals from VR firms Rainforest, At One Ventures, Section 32 and Greylock, where venture funding has declined; and how Fearless Fund, a firm founded to invest in women of color, is being barred from awarding grants to Black women founders.\n\nMeanwhile, Found featured Esther Rodriguez-Villegas from Acurable, a medical device company that makes patient-friendly wearable devices to diagnose and manage respiratory conditions at home. As a career-long academic, Rodriguez-Villegas talks about how she never intended to be a founder until she learned about how the currently available medical devices make it extremely difficult to detect and treat diseases like sleep apnea and epilepsy.\n\nAnd over on Chain Reaction, Jacquelyn did a crossover episode with Alex about the SBF trial. Jacquelyn has been on the ground at the Southern District of New York courthouse, listening in to the trial in the same room as Bankman-Fried, so there was lots to talk about.\n\nTechCrunch+\n\nTC+ subscribers get access to in-depth commentary, analysis and surveys \u2014 which you know if you\u2019re already a subscriber.
